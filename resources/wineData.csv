Ebner-Ebenauer 2017 Hermanschachern Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)	Hermanschachern	94	N/A	Niederösterreich, Austria	Anne Krebiehl MW	@AnneInVino	Contributing Editor	Grüner Veltliner	Ebner-Ebenauer	7/1/2019	White	750 ml	13%	A very subtle nose gives little away. It is on the palate that the fizzing, peppery, salty and savory nature breaks through. This is vivid and slender, energetic and bright. Lime zest and white pepper make for a tingling, moreish and lip-smacking finale.
Beekeeper Cellars 2016 Montecillo Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma County)	Montecillo Vineyard	94	$65	Sonoma County, Sonoma, California, US	Virginie Boone	@vboone	Contributing Editor	Zinfandel	Beekeeper Cellars	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	14.5%	Blended with 5% Petite Sirah and then aged 15 months in all French oak, this is a beautifully made and fun wine to drink, earthy in forest mushroom and grilled meat. The vineyard sits at 1,500 feet in elevation and contributes sizable tannin weight, a worthy companion to the ripe richness of the blueberry cobbler and black pepper at its core.
Domaine Drouhin Oregon 2017 Édition Limitée Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)	Édition Limitée	94	$65	Dundee Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US	Paul Gregutt	@paulgwine	Contributing Editor	Chardonnay	Domaine Drouhin Oregon	7/1/2019	White	750 ml	13.9%	The winery's reserve-level cuvée is sourced from the estate vineyard, same as the Arthur, but here the presence of new oak is more forceful, the fruit a bit richer, and the impact of phenolic overtones more noticeable. It's a young, pungent wine that should benefit from additional bottle age. Drink 2021–2028.
21 Grams 2014 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))	null	94	$125	Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US	Sean P. Sullivan	@wawinereport	Contributing Editor	Bordeaux-style Red Blend	21 Grams	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	14.5%	Cabernet Sauvignon from esteemed Cold Creek Vineyard makes up the backbone of this wine. Intoxicating aromas of assorted dried herbs, graphite, spice, tea leaf, coffee and black cherry are followed by tightly wound dark fruit flavors. The rich flavors show sophistication, layering and depth, with enough acid and tannin structure for 20-plus years of enjoyment. An extended finish only heightens the impression. It's a stunner that overwhelms on expressiveness rather than sheer strength. Best after 2025.
Dierberg 2016 Dierberg Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)	Dierberg Vineyard	94	$32	Santa Maria Valley, Central Coast, California, US	Matt Kettmann	@mattkettmann	Contributing Editor	Chardonnay	Dierberg	7/1/2019	White	750 ml	13.2%	The fascinating nose of this bottling is driven by wet stone, yet it also touches on orange rinds, fresh chives, lemongrass balm and a nearly basil-like aromatic without the green spice. It's lively on the palate with flint and crushed stone, showing very fresh and acid-driven flavors of lemon and ash, riding a firm tension through the sip.
Ebner-Ebenauer 2016 Black Edition Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)	Black Edition	94	N/A	Niederösterreich, Austria	Anne Krebiehl MW	@AnneInVino	Contributing Editor	Grüner Veltliner	Ebner-Ebenauer	7/1/2019	White	750 ml	13%	Something heady, something fresh, something green and something vigorous rises from the glass alongside the creaminess of oak. The milky balm of aloe vera is combined with ferns, fresh hay and tingling white pepper. There is an edge of vanilla, too, complemented by spiky lemon. Layers of flavor shimmer to present a picture of concentrated, buffered but fresh savoriness. Drink now–2035.

Sullivan	@wawinereport	Contributing Editor	Syrah	Latta	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	14.1%	This is the winery's first offering of Syrah. There's no mistaking the fruit comes from The Rocks District, with the area's hallmark aromas of olive, fire pit, charcuterie, plum, dried herb, orange peel and parsley that are intense but still show a sense of subtlety. The palate is textured and rich but still in balance, full of fruit and savory flavors. An insanely long, 30-second-plus finish caps it off. One of the wines of the vintage. Best after 2021.
Quinta de Soalheiro 2017 Reserva Alvarinho Alvarinho (Vinho Verde)	Reserva Alvarinho	94	$40	Vinho Verde, Portugal	Roger Voss	@vossroger	European Editor, Reviews wines from Portugal and France	Alvarinho, Albariño	Quinta de Soalheiro	7/1/2019	White	750 ml	13%	Fermented and aged in oak, this is very different take on Alvarinho. The wood softens to acidity, which instead emphasizes the creaminess and ripeness of the rich fruit. It's ready to drink, although it will certainly age.
Donum 2016 Year of the Monkey Reserve Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)	Year of the Monkey Reserve Single Vineyard	94	$100	Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US	Virginie Boone	@vboone	Contributing Editor	Pinot Noir	Donum	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	14.8%	This is a tightly wound, forceful and weighty wine that displays juicy black cherry and blackberry tones, complemented by firm, textured tannins and accents of clove and tobacco.

Aromas of raspberry, pomegranate and wild thyme lead into a palate that's loaded with strawberry, white pepper and bay leaf, finishing on vanilla cream.
Valdicava 2013 Madonna del Piano Riserva (Brunello di Montalcino)	Madonna del Piano Riserva	94	$300	Brunello di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy	Kerin O’Keefe	@kerinokeefe	Italian Editor	Sangiovese	Valdicava	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	14%	Earthy aromas of wild berry, new leather, truffle and exotic spice emerge from the glass.

Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US	Matt Kettmann	@mattkettmann	Contributing Editor	Pinot Noir	Pali	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	14.3%	Intense black raspberry fruit meets with sagebrush, bay leaf and peppercorn on the extremely complex and inviting nose of this clonal selection. The palate is taut and wound up with bright and expressive red-fruit flavors that are lifted with pinches of cinnamon, marjoram and orange rind.

Aged in neutral wood, it picks up just a gentle lick of vanilla winding through the finish. Decant this wine, as it has the depth to reward extra-long aeration.
Wohlmuth 2017 Ried Edelschuh Riesling (Südsteiermark)	Ried Edelschuh	94	$22	Südsteiermark, Austria	Anne Krebiehl MW	@AnneInVino	Contributing Editor	Riesling	Wohlmuth	7/1/2019	White	750 ml	13%	All manner of fruit rises gently from the glass. There is the obligatory citrus but that plays around ripe peach, and tropical passion fruit, with its lemon and tangerine charm. The body is slender, sinuous and juicy, with ripe and mild but pure lemon freshness. A hint of creaminess is also present. This is an elegant and smooth Riesling with layers and layers of fruit. Drink 2020–2030.
Brooks Note 2016 Pinot Noir (Marin County)	null	94	$36	Marin County, North Coast, California, US	Jim Gordon	@gordone_cellars	Contributing Editor	Pinot Noir	Brooks Note	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	13.9%	Bold, ripe and concentrated, this full-bodied wine is one of the bigger and more robust Pinot examples out there. Without obvious oakiness, it shows abundant flavors of black cherry, cranberry and sour cherry that are pure and focused. It shows excellent depth, ample acidity and a firm tannic that will help it improve with age. Best after 2023.
Lange 2016 Lange Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)	Lange Estate Vineyard	94	$70	Dundee Hills, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US	Paul Gregutt	@paulgwine	Contributing Editor	Pinot Noir	Lange	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	13.9%	The estate vineyard, planted in the late 1980s, is at optimal maturity, as this spicy, expressive and thoroughly captivating wine demonstrates. Lifted raspberry and black cherry fruit, aromatic and perfectly ripened, benefits from judiciously used new oak (35%), which adds toasty coffee flavors to the finish. There's a light touch of clean earth and a spicy pine scent underscoring the lovely fruit.
Slyd 2016 The Show Syrah (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)	The Show	94	$38	Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California, US	Matt Kettmann	@mattkettmann	Contributing Editor	Syrah	Slyd	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	14.5%	Aromas of black cherry, cracked peppercorn and smoke make for a delicious combination on the nose of this bottling, one of the few Syrahs from Happy Canyon.

The bubbles are precise on the palate, which snaps with a fresh tangerine rind flavor, but also offers a bit more broad orchard fruit flavors as well.
Dutton-Goldfield 2016 Emerald Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley)	Emerald Ridge Vineyard	94	$68	Green Valley, Sonoma, California, US	Virginie Boone	@vboone	Contributing Editor	Pinot Noir	Dutton-Goldfield	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	13.5%	From an east-facing knoll in the heart of the appellation, this is an earthy red showing barrel oak and tea accents lifted by bright acidity and ongoing freshness.

Delas Frères 2016 Les Bressards (Hermitage)	Les Bressards	94	$257	Hermitage, Rhône Valley, France	Anna Lee C. Iijima		Contributing Editor	Rhône-style Red Blend	Delas Frères	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	14%	While decadently fruit-forward for Hermitage, this rich, unctuous wine maintains the region's characteristic minerality and earthen complexities. Ripe black-cherry and plum flavors are warmed by spicy notes of anise and caramelized sugar along with fine, smooth tannins. It's a ripe, rather potent expression of Syrah but finessed enough to improve through 2030 and likely hold further.
Beauregard 2017 Bald Mountain Vineyard Sand Hill Chardonnay (Ben Lomond Mountain)	Bald Mountain Vineyard Sand Hill	94	$65	Ben Lomond Mountain, Central Coast, California, US	Matt Kettmann	@mattkettmann	Contributing Editor	Chardonnay	Beauregard	7/1/2019	White	750 ml	N/A	There is a sharply mineral focus to the nose of this bottling, which shows aromas of wet gravel alongside lemon peel, lemon blossoms and a touch of ripe nectarine.

Iijima		Contributing Editor	Rhône-style Red Blend	Château La Nerthe	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	14.5%	There's a rich, decadent core of black cherry, plum and strawberry in this wine, but it's layered with piquant accents of anise, smoke, earth and fur. It's richly fruity but freshly composed and fringed by fine, persistent tannins. Ready to drink now, it should improve through 2030.

Matured in 100% new oak, it will need some time in the cellar to allow its core of ripe blackberry and plum flavors plus nuances of mint and bramble to peek through. It's quite decadent now but should ease up a bit from 2023.

Domaine de la Bégude 2016 La Brulade Red (Bandol)	La Brulade	94	$84	Bandol, Provence, France	Roger Voss	@vossroger	European Editor, Reviews wines from Portugal and France	Red Blends	Domaine de la Bégude	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	14%	This wine is produced from organic grapes, wood aged for 18 months and powered by ripe tannins and a balanced structure that molds rich fruit and acidity into an intense structure.

The percentage of new oak seems to be higher than in the other 2016s, with brilliant cherry fruit matching the sweet toast. Best guess is tuck a few bottles away and start drinking in the mid-2020s; from there it could go another decade.

Raw tannins along with fresh acidity make for an intense palate that's nowhere near at peak, while this tastes of black fruits, toasty oak, chocolate and baking spices. On the finish, a residual oak flavor and related spice notes along with hard tannins suggest that you don't rush this. Drink through 2032.

The creamy, complex palate delivers ripe apricot, yellow apple and lemon zest alongside fennel seed and a hint of acacia honey.

Broadly tasting of strawberry and pie cherry fruit, this carries a touch of blood orange in the supple acidity. It lingers gracefully with gentle hints of toast and caramel.
Alain Jaume et Fils 2016 Vieux Terron Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)	Vieux Terron	93	$45	Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Rhône Valley, France	Anna Lee C. Iijima		Contributing Editor	Rhône-style Red Blend	Alain Jaume et Fils	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	15%	While crisp blackberry and plum aromas are demure on the nose of this wine, they intensify and ripen on the palate. It's a bold, brawny, wine with densely concentrated, juicy black-fruit flavors. Approachably fruity, it's lifted by a crisp mineral finish and fine, feathery tannins. Drink now–2026.

The mouthfeel is fruited and rounded yet balanced and textured all at once, with a lovely bitterness and a lick of salted butter that play against the ripe orchard and citrus fruit flavors. Lingering notes of waxy melon, orange rind and whole spice like nutmeg and allspice unfold on the long, lightly nutty finish. It's a charmer that's hard to resist, but will age well through 2030.
Lange 2016 Yamhill-Carlton Assemblage Pinot Noir (Yamhill-Carlton)	Yamhill-Carlton Assemblage	93	$70	Yamhill-Carlton, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US	Paul Gregutt	@paulgwine	Contributing Editor	Pinot Noir	Lange	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	14.2%	This reserve level selection, sourced from Yamhill Vineyards, offers sweet black cherry fruit adorned with rich streaks of cola, caramel and espresso.

The product of a ripe vintage, it's a richer, more fruit-forward style of Hermitage than what's typical but maintains the appellation's brambly, granitic edges too. Drink now–2030.

It's moderately full and remarkably juicy in style but freshly balanced and framed by firm, persistent tannins.

The color is deep red at the rim and black within. Complex, spicy and evolved aromas are followed by ripe blackberry and dark chocolate flavors that are concentrated and lingering.

Don't let the slight barnyard funk put you off (after all, Burgundy excels at this aroma). It dissipates in glass, leaving in its wake something quite beautiful: fresh red cherries, whole bunch stalkiness, an array of florals and spice and a meaty undertone. It's silky, textured and plump-fruited, with a hearty grip of herbal savory tannins. As per usual with these wines, elegance, complexity and age-worthiness are the name of the game. Serve beside warming, gamy fare or cellar until 2027.

Rita Hills, Central Coast, California, US	Matt Kettmann	@mattkettmann	Contributing Editor	Pinot Noir	Dierberg	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	13.9%	This bottling from a vineyard in the heart of the Sta. Rita Hills begins with aromas of earthy soils, dried herbs and bright Bing cherries. The palate's dark red, almost boysenberry fruit tones are both crisp and ripe, wrapped in a rocky, earthy tension that's mouthfilling and bright, finishing on a hint of French toast.
Kelley Fox 2017 Barbie Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley)	Barbie	93	$35	Willamette Valley, Willamette Valley, Oregon, US	Paul Gregutt	@paulgwine	Contributing Editor	Pinot Blanc	Kelley Fox	7/1/2019	White	750 ml	13%	This looks to be the first vintage for a Kelley Fox Pinot Blanc, and there are two, both sourced from the Freedom Hill vineyard.

A tough, drawing palate features scraping tannins, while this tastes of frontal oak backed by tea, cola, savory meat and, of course, berry fruit. A long finish is decidedly oaky, but this muscular and massive single-vineyard Tempranillo can handle the wood factor. Drink through 2030.
Parrish Family 2016 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaida District)	Reserve	93	$70	Adelaida District, Central Coast, California, US	Matt Kettmann	@mattkettmann	Contributing Editor	Cabernet Sauvignon	Parrish Family	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	14.5%	Quite thick in the glass, this reserve bottling by longtime grower David Parrish starts with inviting, delicious aromas of black cherry, pencil shavings and loamy soils.

Iijima		Contributing Editor	Rhône-style Red Blend	Tardieu-Laurent	7/1/2019	Red	750 ml	14.5%	There's a regal, weighty feel to this powerful yet finessed red.
